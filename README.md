# DesertSeeker 🐱🏜️  
**Neural Architecture Search using Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO)**

---

## 🌟 Overview
`DesertSeeker` is a **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** framework powered by the **Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO)** algorithm.  

Inspired by the hunting behavior of sand cats:  
- **Exploration**: Detecting low-frequency signals to search for prey.  
- **Exploitation**: Rapid attack to capture prey.  

This project applies the same principle to automatically explore and optimize deep neural network architectures.

---

## 📖 Features
- Population-based **SCSO optimization** balancing exploration and exploitation.  
- Search space includes layers, neurons, and types of neural operations.  
- Flexible objective functions (e.g., accuracy, loss, multi-objective trade-offs).  
- Lightweight, easy-to-implement, and extensible codebase.
